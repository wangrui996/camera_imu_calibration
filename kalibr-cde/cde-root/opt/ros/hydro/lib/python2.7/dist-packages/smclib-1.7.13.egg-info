Description: The State Machine Compiler (SMC) from http://smc.sourceforge.net/
            converts a language-independent description of a state machine
            into the source code to support that state machine.
        
            This package contains the libraries that a compiled state machine
            depends on, but it does not contain the compiler itself.
